/* A. 7 4 - since the loop increases n twice n goes from 0 to 2 to 4 the stops the loop. 0 plus 1 is 1, 1 plus 2 is 3, and finally 3 plus 4 is 7 stoping the loop making s 7
// B. Value of i is: 3 - The loop starts by dividing y by 2 making the new y .5 then adds .5 to x making the new x 1.5 and increases i to 1 since 1.5 isnt greater than 1.8 the loop repeats. Y becomes .25 x become 1.75 and i becomes 3. Y becomes .125 and x becomes 1.875 and i becomes 3. Since x is now larger than 1.8 the loop ends and i which is 3 is printed
// C.   ===== - The loop start at 0 and increases by 1 until i isn't less than 10. It will divide i by 2 and if the remainder is 0 it will print strips else it will print stars. so it prints stripes, stars, stripes, stars, stripes, stars, stripes, stars, stripes, stars, then stops because i isn't less than 10 anymore

    D. **** - In the loop i starts out as 0 and it will print the substring of plus from 0 to i and the substring of stars from i to 4 then creates a new line and i increases by one after every loop. so the loop prints 0 pluses and 4 stars creates a new line, 1 plus and 3 stars creates a new line, 2 pluses and 2 stars creates a new line, and 3 pluses and 1 star creates a new line. The loop then stops because i is no longer less than 4
